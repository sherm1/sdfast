 *
 * In this example, the hollow outer sphere is fixed to ground.  The inner 
 * sphere moves inside, and may be
 *         1) free in the interior,
 *         2) rolling along the inside surface, or
 *         3) slipping along the inside surface.
 *
 * Most of the code below deals with recognizing and implementing the 
 * transitions among these three conditions.  Collisions between the
 * spheres are modeled as impacts, with a coefficient of restitution.
 * A static and dynamic coefficient of friction are used to model
 * the behavior of the spheres when slipping, whether along the 
 * surface or at a point during an impact.  No attempt is made to
 * model rolling resistance, although that could easily be added.  It would
 * also be straightforward to allow the outer sphere to move relative to
 * ground, but that has not been done here.
 *
 * The simplest way to model this system with SD/FAST would be to "attach" the 
 * inner sphere to ground with a six degree-of-freedom joint.  However, this
 * would require us to write some equations to convert the resulting
 * coordinates into more appropriate spherical coordinates.  Instead, we
 * compose several joints (using two intermediate massless frames) to 
 * produce spherical coordinates directly, and let SD/FAST write the equations.
 *
 *                  .---.              y
 *                / INNER \            |               |
 *                |   O   |            |____x          | gravity -9.8y
 *                \       /           /                V
 *          OUTER   `---'            z
 *                                  
 * The first massless frame, called LATLONG, is attached to the 
 * point at the center of the outer sphere by a U-joint (two perpendicular
 * rotational degrees of freedom).  The first coordinate is a rotation 
 * about y (corresponding to longitude), the second is a rotation about x
 * (corresponding to latitude).  
 *
 * The other massless frame, called RADIUS, is attached to LATLONG by
 * a sliding joint in the RADIUS local y direction.  This coordinate
 * represents the radial distance from the outer sphere center to the
 * inner sphere center.  The inner sphere is attached to the RADIUS
 * frame by a ball joint at its center.
 * 
 * In the chosen reference configuration, where all the coordinates
 * are zero, the inner sphere is in the center of the outer sphere.
 * If the RADIUS coordinate is set to (R_OUTER-R_INNER) while all
 * other coordinates are left zero, the inner sphere touches the
 * outer sphere at the top.  Note that this means the latitude is
 * considered zero at the top, 90 degrees at the equator, contrary to
 * common practice on maps where the equator is at zero latitude.
 *
 * Three constraints are used in the model to (1) prevent the inner
 * sphere from penetrating the outer sphere, and (2) while the inner
 * sphere should be rolling, to prevent relative slipping between
 * the surfaces (in two directions).  These constraints are turned on
 * and off as appropriate.  The first is enabled only when the the
 * sphere is rolling or sliding along the inner surface, and the
 * other two constraints are enabled only while rolling.
 *
 * The "non-penetration" constraint is implemented using SD/FAST's built-in
 * prescribed motion facility on the RADIUS sliding joint.  Whenever
 * the spheres are supposed to maintain contact, the inner
 * sphere is simply presribed to be at the radius which just causes it
 * to contact the outer sphere.  The sign of the resulting constraint
 * multiplier is monitored, and the prescribed motion constraint is turned
 * off if it would prevent the inner sphere from moving into the interior.
 *
 * The "no-slip" constraints are implemented using SD/FAST's "user constraint"
 * facility.  These constraints are enabled only when the spheres are 
 * supposed to be in rolling contact.  When on, the resulting force (found
 * in the multipliers) is monitored and if its magnitude exceeds the
 * static coefficient of friction times the normal force, the constraints
 * are turned off and the sphere begins to slip.
 *
 * The variable-step integrator provided with SD/FAST is used to advance
 * time.  This integrator is capable of precisely locating events in
 * time, and we use this feature to isolate in time the transitions
 * among the free, rolling and slipping conditions.  This way errors are
 * avoided which would occur if a single integration step contained transitions.
 *
 * The SD/FAST root finder is used to solve the impact problem.  It is also
 * used in the transition from slipping to rolling to eliminate any
 * residual slipping velocity when the decision is made to roll.
 *
 * Fixed-point iteration is used to solve for the friction forces during
 * sliding.  
 *
 * Here are the rules for changing from one condition to another:
 *
 *   From        To          When
 *
 *   UNKNOWN     FREE        Inner sphere is not touching the outer sphere.
 *   UNKNOWN     ROLLING     Inner sphere touching and required tangential
 *                             force does not exceed mu_static*normal_force.
 *   UNKNOWN     SLIPPING    Inner sphere touching and tangential force 
 *                             required for rolling > mu_static*normal_force.
 *
 *   FREE        ROLLING     Impact produces rebound velocity less than
 *                             EPS_MINREBOUNDVEL, and required tangential
 *                             force <= mu_static*normal_force.
 *   FREE        SLIPPING    Impact produces rebound velocity less than
 *                             EPS_MINREBOUNDVEL, and tangential force required
 *                             to produce rolling > mu_static*normal_force.
 *
 *   ROLLING     FREE        Normal force preventing inner sphere from
 *                             penetrating outer changes sign.
 *   ROLLING     SLIPPING    Tangential force required to continue rolling
 *                             would exceed mu_static*normal_force.
 *
 *   SLIPPING    FREE        Normal force preventing inner sphere from
 *                             penetrating outer changes sign.
 *   SLIPPING    ROLLING     Relative slip velocity drops below EPS_MINSLIPVEL,
 *                             and is decreasing.
