 *     sdvinteg(f, time, y, dy, param, dt, step, neq, tol, work, err, which)
 *         void (*f)();
 *         double *time, y[], dy[], param[], dt, *step, tol, work[6*neq];
 *         int neq,*err,*which;
 *
 *     f is f(time,y,dy,param,int *status)
 *
 * A variable timestep Runga-Kutta-Merson integrator.  The function
 * f is called to compute the derivatives of the state variables y.  (The
 * initial derivative is passed in, however, in dy.) These
 * are integrated between time and time+dt, with relative error normally kept
 * to below reltol.  When a function value is near zero,
 * the relative error can become very large even though the absolute error
 * is still small.  In case an absolute error is <= .1*tol, no further
 * attempt is made to reduce relative accuracy.
 *
 * Note: tolerance applies only within a single integration interval.
 * In the worst case, EVERY interval could introduce an error the size
 * of reltol.  If these were all in the same direction, the global error
 * could be much larger than tol.  But it should be bounded by tol*n
 * where n is the number of timesteps made.  Normally the errors are
 * not systematic so the global error will be pretty good.
 *
 * `step' is used as an initial guess at the stepsize, and is returned
 * as a suggested initial step size for the next call to vinteg.  This 
 * reflects a "locality" assumption that the function's behavior in
 * the next interval is likely to be similar to its behavior in the
 * current interval.
 *
 * On return y, and time will have been updated.  dy will contain 
 * f(time+dt, y), i.e., the derivative of y at time+dt.
 *
 * If neq is passed in as a negative number, sdvinteg will return after
 * taking a single successful step.  In that case, time will be updated
 * by AT MOST dt, but more likely it will come back earlier.  This lets
 * the caller (e.g. Applied Motion) grab control after every successful
 * integration step.
 *
 * Err is returned 0 if we're successful.  Other returns are:
 *   err=1   Error estimates forced the step size too small, but then after
 *           a single `bad' minimum-width step, the error estimates got
 *           reasonable again.  This suggests that we 
 *           integrated over a step.  In that case, `which' is the index of 
 *           the function exhibiting the first alleged discontinuity during 
 *           the interval.  The entire interval is integrated, however.
 *
 *   err=2   Can't continue integrating.  This means that the error estimate
 *           became large and didn't go back to normal after taking a 
 *           minimum-width step.  Time, y, and dy are returned just after
 *           the last successful step, just before the bad spot.  This is
 *           most likely a lockup point, beyond which constraints would be
 *           inconsistent.  `Which' says which function had the problem.
 *
 *   err=3   The user-supplied function f returned with a non-zero status.
 *           The actual status is reported in `which'.  The returned time,
 *           y, and dy are those from just before (within a step of width tol)
 *           the point at which the function would have returned non-zero.
 *
 *     sdfinteg(f, time, y, dy, param, step, neq, work, errest, status)
 *         void (*f)();
 *         double *time, y[], dy[], param[], step, work[4*neq], *errest;
 *         int neq, *status;
 *
 * A fixed timestep Runge-Kutta 4th order integrator.  The function
 * f is called to compute the derivatives of the state variables y.  These
 * are integrated between time and time+step.  An estimate of the 
 * integration error introduced in the step is returned in errest.  (This
 * is the same value used to measure against the user-supplied `tol'
 * value in sdvinteg(); i.e., it is the `tol' actually achieved by the
 * step.
 *
 * dy should initially contain f(time,y).
 *
 * On return y and time will have been updated.
 * dy will contain f(time+step, y), i.e., the derivative of y at time+step.
 * The status returned by f() on this final call is returned in status.
